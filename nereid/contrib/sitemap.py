class SitemapSection(object):
    """A SitemapSection class is a simple Python class that represents a
    "section" of  entries in your sitemap. For example, one Sitemap class could
    represent all the entries of your weblog, while another could represent all
    of the events in your events calendar.

    In the simplest case, all these sections get lumped together into one
    `sitemap.xml`, but it's also possible to use the framework to generate a
    sitemap index that references individual sitemap files, one per section.

    The implementation though inspired by the Django project, is heavily
    influenced around the design of the Tryton project.


    How to use::

        Step 1: Create a method name sitemap for each model that needs to use
                a sitemap. Example:

                class Product(ModelSQL, ModelView):
                    _name = "product.product"

                    def sitemap(self, page):
                        sitemap_section = SitemapSection(
                            self, self.search_domain, page
                            )
                        return sitemap_section.render()

                    def get_absolute_url(self, browse_record, **kwargs):
                        "Return the full_path of the current object"
                        return url_for('product.product.render',
                            uri=browse_record.uri, **kwargs)


    :param model: The Tryton model/object from which the pagination needs to
        be generated. Passing `self` from the calling object's method would be
        the usual way you will have to pass this argument
    :param domain: The domain expression which should be searched against in
        the model
    :param page: The page of the sitemap.
